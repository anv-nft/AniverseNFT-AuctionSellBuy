# Aniverse - Auction Market Solidity File



## Getting Started 

#### 1. Auction Market Solidity
>  Auction Market Solidity file in exactly the same ways as Fixed Price Solidity is a java script code executed when buying or creating NTF in the form of Auction. In this case, the code checks when the Auction ends and selects the highest price from the list. NTF is sent to the one who offered the highest price, and the rest of the participants receive their tokens in return, and this whole function is performed automatically.
